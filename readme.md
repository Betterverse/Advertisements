This is the BetterVerse, home of two servers - soon to be three.

There is The Bettercraft, the original server of the 'verse.  It is an economic, or political, server. How you play is entirely up to you, but some ways are more effective than others.  There is a large community and a plethora of plugins custom developed for the server; so long as you're willing to play by the rules, you will find an enjoyable experience here.


On a different note, there is the BetterAnarchy; a server with few rules and just as much potential for exciting gameplay.  While there is no typical grief rule, there is a safeguard for your previous homes.

In a system belonging only to the Betterverse, and customized even further for the Anarchy server, is our Raiding plugin.  You have the option to spend your hard-earned money on protecting your land, even from the very start. This protection does not render you immune to theft and destruction, however.  Others may come up to your home and dig through or under the walls, searching for your valuables.  After a short period of time, however, your home will return to its former glory.  Your chests may have been looted, but your home will remain intact.  It is up to you to defend your goods, or to build your home in such a way that you can be safe.
